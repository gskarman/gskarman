- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gskarman

My Name is Gustav Skarman and im (so far) a self thaught google cloud expert. I love my JS programming and are on GitHub to better my CI/CD knowledge.

I live in Stockholm/Sweden and spend most of my time on vanilla JS projects and Next.js projects. I have big dreams of creating a SaaS one day and it might come sooner than expected.

So keep your eyes peeled - ðŸ‘€

Best way to contact me is through my mail:
